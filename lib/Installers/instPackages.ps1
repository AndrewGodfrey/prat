# There are so many package managers. Let's make another one!
#
# Requirements:
#   1. Non-interactive: For some reason, many packages (and package managers!) think it's appropriate to ask the 'user' a question.
#      All of these need to be suppressed.
#   2. Speed: Incremental development requires that "nothing to do" cases are very quick. Speed is also desirable given the 'cattle not pets' philosophy
#      - for packages this means: avoid depending on uninstallers; prefer to reset and rebuild.
#   3. Reliability and availability: The typical approach is to apply 'latest' and if it breaks anything, to discover and resolve that manually.
#      IMO this needs to be automated, keeping the target system working (pinning to the last-known-good version) until resolved.
#   4. Recency: Pinning indefinitely to a known-good version, works in the short term but eventually fails, for many reasons.
#      So the system should resist long-term pinning. (If a dependency has gone in a bad direction permanently, then it's time for a fork).
#   5. Abstraction: Keep in one place the 'boring' package-specific information, e.g.:
#     - Which package manager should we use?
#     - Does it need additional parameters to make it automatic? (Things like accepting licenses, acknowledging an upgrade)
#     - nuget (and many others) adds itself to PATH in the registry, but not in the currently-running environment. (Some other packages also
#       update the currently-running environment, but many don't). This breaks scripts; we can work around this here.
#     - Some packages make huge breaking changes from one major version to another. For those, auto-updating logic may need to focus on minor version #.
#     - Later, I might re-encounter the need for multiple side-by-side versions (of a package which supports that). In such cases you need
#       some way of picking which one to invoke. One way is to know its installation path, which isn't provided and doesn't follow any rigid convention.
#
# Thoughts:
#   - I'm aware that Powershell already has a "package manager manager" in Install-Package. Based on past experience, I expect this code to use 
#     winget directly, and nuget directly, and occasionally Install-Package. If Install-Package were to improve to meet all the requirements,
#     I wouldn't complain! But that seems like a tall order - much more work than I have to do here (because I can ignore packages I don't use).
#
#   - Local caching of packages is highly desirable, but NYI. I had a look at winget's support for caching, and it seems unduly complicated. I expect to need caching
#     eventually. Here are some reasons it's so desirable:
#     - Another 'availability' risk is that a version you depend on could be removed from the repository, or the repository could go down for a while.
#     - A local cache helps with speed, and reducing internet bandwidth load/congestion/costs. Especially so, considering the 'cattle not pets' philosophy,
#       and the desire to automate testing of the 'new machine' scenario. (e.g. How many times can I download the Git package before someone complains?)
#     - A local cache might also give an opportunity to simplify - if we only add a package to the cache after it has passed (some version of) our tests.
#       I'm not sure.


# This is the 'spackle' mentioned in the file comment: Some packages emit "Path environment variable modified; restart your shell to use the new value.".
# To avoid stopping the script at this point, we need to a) hope we can predict the new value, and b) add it to $env:path.
# 
# TODO: Could we reliably update it from the registry?
